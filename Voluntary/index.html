	  <h1>Other activities I am invested in</h1>
	  <h2>Role-playing games</h2>
	  <p>I love role-playing games, especially what is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_mystery_game" target="_blank">murder mystery game</a>. I like playing to it but also mastering it. I wrote one (in French) entitled "Le clan Fratelli".</p>
	  <h2>Drama</h2>
	  <p>I love drama: watching it but also playing it. I have been playing drama for 7 years in total.</p>
	  <h2>Writing</h2>
	  <p>I write article for the student jounral "La Sauce" of my school. I have a serial called "Fibre Sentimentale", where I try to talk analyse all kinds of contingent and recurring feelings. I also broach the French Language to try to make French people see it differently. The first trilogy <a href="LangueFrancaise1-ValentinDRichard-2019.pdf" target="_blank">Langue française : des réponses aux sottises</a> is available.<p>
	  <h2>Board games</h2>
	  <p>I like to play board games. In 2019, the game club BdL (Bureau des Loisirs), of which I was the president, organised a big game event between the 4 ENSs of France: "Les Interludes". Here is the poster I made (using Inkscape) to announce the event.</p>
